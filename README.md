# Project title: PORTFOLIO

## Purpose of Project

My project was to demonstrate skills that I have learnt during wk2 of Coding Bootcamp. This task involved <br> having to build the code for both HTML and Styles.Css to deploy a website that I can use to  showcase my work to future employers.
My website is presented with an image of myself in the main header, including my name and what I am currently learning.

My website has enabled the use of core skills I have recently learned: media queries, flexbox, etc.
You are able to select a heading and it will take you that section, so it is interactive when accessed.
